/** \defgroup avr_io <avr/io.h>: AVR device-specific IO definitions
    \code #include <avr/io.h> \endcode
    This header file includes the apropriate IO definitions for the
    device that has been specified by the <tt>-mmcu=</tt> compiler
    command-line switch.  This is done by diverting to the appropriate
    file <tt>&lt;avr/io</tt><em>XXXX</em><tt>.h&gt;</tt> which should
    never be included directly.  Some register names common to all
    AVR devices are defined directly within <tt>&lt;avr/common.h&gt;</tt>,
    which is included in <tt>&lt;avr/io.h&gt;</tt>,
    but most of the details come from the respective include file.
    Note that this file always includes the following files:
    \code 
    #include <avr/sfr_defs.h>
    #include <avr/portpins.h>
    #include <avr/common.h>
    #include <avr/version.h>
    \endcode
    See \ref avr_sfr for more details about that header file.
    Included are definitions of the IO register set and their
    respective bit values as specified in the Atmel documentation.
    Note that inconsistencies in naming conventions,
    so even identical functions sometimes get different names on
    different devices.
    Also included are the specific names useable for interrupt
    function definitions as documented
    \ref avr_signames "here".
    Finally, the following macros are defined:
    - \b RAMEND
    <br>
    The last on-chip RAM address.
    <br>
    - \b XRAMEND
    <br>
    The last possible RAM location that is addressable. This is equal to 
    RAMEND for devices that do not allow for external RAM. For devices 
    that allow external RAM, this will be larger than RAMEND.
    <br>
    - \b E2END
    <br>
    The last EEPROM address.
    <br>
    - \b FLASHEND
    <br>
    The last byte address in the Flash program space.
    <br>
    - \b SPM_PAGESIZE
    <br>
    For devices with bootloader support, the flash pagesize
    (in bytes) to be used for the \c SPM instruction. 
    - \b E2PAGESIZE
    <br>
    The size of the EEPROM page.

/* avr/sfr_defs.h - macros for accessing AVR special function registers */
/* $Id$ */
/** \defgroup avr_sfr_notes Additional notes from <avr/sfr_defs.h>
    \ingroup avr_sfr
   The \c <avr/sfr_defs.h> file is included by all of the \c <avr/ioXXXX.h>
   files, which use macros defined here to make the special function register
   definitions look like C variables or simple constants, depending on the
   <tt>_SFR_ASM_COMPAT</tt> define.  Some examples from \c <avr/iocanxx.h> to
   show how to define such macros:
\code
\endcode
   If \c _SFR_ASM_COMPAT is not defined, C programs can use names like
   <tt>PORTA</tt> directly in C expressions (also on the left side of
   assignment operators) and GCC will do the right thing (use short I/O
   instructions if possible).  The \c __SFR_OFFSET definition is not used in
   any way in this case.
   Define \c _SFR_ASM_COMPAT as 1 to make these names work as simple constants
   (addresses of the I/O registers).  This is necessary when included in
   preprocessed assembler (*.S) source files, so it is done automatically if
   \c __ASSEMBLER__ is defined.  By default, all addresses are defined as if
   they were memory addresses (used in \c lds/sts instructions).  To use these
   addresses in \c in/out instructions, you must subtract 0x20 from them.
   For more backwards compatibility, insert the following at the start of your
   old assembler source file:
\code
\endcode
   This automatically subtracts 0x20 from I/O space addresses, but it's a
   hack, so it is recommended to change your source: wrap such addresses in
   macros defined here, as shown below.  After this is done, the
   <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> definition is no longer necessary and can be removed.
   Real example - this code could be used in a boot loader that is portable
   between devices with \c SPMCR at different addresses.
\verbatim
<avr/iom163.h>: #define SPMCR _SFR_IO8(0x37)
<avr/iom128.h>: #define SPMCR _SFR_MEM8(0x68)
\endverbatim
\code
	out	_SFR_IO_ADDR(SPMCR), r24
	sts	_SFR_MEM_ADDR(SPMCR), r24
\endcode
   You can use the \c in/out/cbi/sbi/sbic/sbis instructions, without the
   <tt>_SFR_IO_REG_P</tt> test, if you know that the register is in the I/O
   space (as with \c SREG, for example).  If it isn't, the assembler will
   complain (I/O address out of range 0...0x3f), so this should be fairly
   safe.
   If you do not define \c __SFR_OFFSET (so it will be 0x20 by default), all
   special register addresses are defined as memory addresses (so \c SREG is
   0x5f), and (if code size and speed are not important, and you don't like
   the ugly \#if above) you can always use lds/sts to access them.  But, this
   will not work if <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> != 0x20, so use a different macro
   (defined only if <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> == 0x20) for safety:
\code
	sts	_SFR_ADDR(SPMCR), r24
\endcode
   In C programs, all 3 combinations of \c _SFR_ASM_COMPAT and
   <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> are supported - the \c _SFR_ADDR(SPMCR) macro can be
   used to get the address of the \c SPMCR register (0x57 or 0x68 depending on
   device). */
/* These only work in C programs.  */

    \code #include <inttypes.h> \endcode
    This header file includes the exact-width integer definitions from
    <tt><stdint.h></tt>, and extends them with additional facilities
    provided by the implementation.
    Currently, the extensions include two additional integer types
    that could hold a "far" pointer (i.e. a code pointer that can
    address more than 64 KB), as well as standard names for all printf
    and scanf formatting options that are supported by the \ref avr_stdio.
    As the library does not support the full range of conversion
    specifiers from ISO 9899:1999, only those conversions that are
    actually implemented will be listed here.
    The idea behind these conversion macros is that, for each of the
    types defined by <stdint.h>, a macro will be supplied that portably
    allows formatting an object of that type in printf() or scanf()
    operations.  Example:
    \code
    #include <inttypes.h>
    uint8_t smallval;
    int32_t longval;
    ...
    printf("The hexadecimal value of smallval is %" PRIx8
           ", the decimal value of longval is %" PRId32 ".\n",

    This header file defines macros that contain version numbers and

    The version number itself basically consists of three pieces that
    are separated by a dot: the major number, the minor number, and
    the revision number.  For development versions (which use an odd
    minor number), the string representation additionally gets the
    date code (YYYYMMDD) appended.
    This file will also be included by \c <avr/io.h>.  That way,
    portable tests can be implemented using \c <avr/io.h> that can be
    used in code that wants to remain backwards-compatible to library
    versions prior to the date when the library version API had been
    added, as referenced but undefined C preprocessor macros
    automatically evaluate to 0.

/** \defgroup avr_fuse <avr/fuse.h>: Fuse Support
    \par Introduction
    The Fuse API allows a user to specify the fuse settings for the specific
    AVR device they are compiling for. These fuse settings will be placed
    in a special section in the ELF output file, after linking.
    Programming tools can take advantage of the fuse information embedded in
    the ELF file, by extracting this information and determining if the fuses
    need to be programmed before programming the Flash and EEPROM memories.
    This also allows a single ELF file to contain all the
    information needed to program an AVR. 
    To use the Fuse API, include the <avr/io.h> header file, which in turn
    automatically includes the individual I/O header file and the <avr/fuse.h>
    file. These other two files provides everything necessary to set the AVR
    fuses.
    
    \par Fuse API
    
    Each I/O header file must define the FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE macro which is
    defined to the number of fuse bytes that exist in the AVR device.
    
    A new type, __fuse_t, is defined as a structure. The number of fields in 
    this structure are determined by the number of fuse bytes in the 
    FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE macro.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE == 1, there is only a single field: byte, of type
    unsigned char.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE == 2, there are two fields: low, and high, of type
    unsigned char.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE == 3, there are three fields: low, high, and extended,
    of type unsigned char.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE > 3, there is a single field: byte, which is an array
    of unsigned char with the size of the array being FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE.
    
    A convenience macro, FUSEMEM, is defined as a GCC attribute for a 
    custom-named section of ".fuse".
    
    A convenience macro, FUSES, is defined that declares a variable, __fuse, of
    type __fuse_t with the attribute defined by FUSEMEM. This variable
    allows the end user to easily set the fuse data.
    \note If a device-specific I/O header file has previously defined FUSEMEM,
    then FUSEMEM is not redefined. If a device-specific I/O header file has
    previously defined FUSES, then FUSES is not redefined.
    Each AVR device I/O header file has a set of defined macros which specify the
    actual fuse bits available on that device. The AVR fuses have inverted
    values, logical 1 for an unprogrammed (disabled) bit and logical 0 for a
    programmed (enabled) bit. The defined macros for each individual fuse
    bit represent this in their definition by a bit-wise inversion of a mask.
    For example, the FUSE_EESAVE fuse in the ATmega128 is defined as:
    \code
    #define FUSE_EESAVE      ~_BV(3)
    \endcode
    \note The _BV macro creates a bit mask from a bit number. It is then 
    inverted to represent logical values for a fuse memory byte.
    
    To combine the fuse bits macros together to represent a whole fuse byte,
    use the bitwise AND operator, like so:
    \code
    (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN)
    \endcode
    
    Each device I/O header file also defines macros that provide default values
    for each fuse byte that is available. LFUSE_DEFAULT is defined for a Low
    Fuse byte. HFUSE_DEFAULT is defined for a High Fuse byte. EFUSE_DEFAULT
    is defined for an Extended Fuse byte.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE > 3, then the I/O header file defines macros that
    provide default values for each fuse byte like so:
    FUSE0_DEFAULT
    FUSE1_DEFAULT
    FUSE2_DEFAULT
    FUSE3_DEFAULT
    FUSE4_DEFAULT
    ....
    
    \par API Usage Example
    
    Putting all of this together is easy. Using C99's designated initializers:
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>
    FUSES = 
    {
        .low = LFUSE_DEFAULT,
        .high = (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN),
        .extended = EFUSE_DEFAULT,
    };
    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    Or, using the variable directly instead of the FUSES macro,
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>
    __fuse_t __fuse __attribute__((section (".fuse"))) = 
    {
        .low = LFUSE_DEFAULT,
        .high = (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN),
        .extended = EFUSE_DEFAULT,
    };
    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    If you are compiling in C++, you cannot use the designated intializers so
    you must do:
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>
    FUSES = 
    {
        LFUSE_DEFAULT, // .low
        (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN), // .high
        EFUSE_DEFAULT, // .extended
    };
    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    
    However there are a number of caveats that you need to be aware of to
    use this API properly.
    
    Be sure to include <avr/io.h> to get all of the definitions for the API.
    The FUSES macro defines a global variable to store the fuse data. This 
    variable is assigned to its own linker section. Assign the desired fuse 
    values immediately in the variable initialization.
    
    The .fuse section in the ELF file will get its values from the initial 
    variable assignment ONLY. This means that you can NOT assign values to 
    this variable in functions and the new values will not be put into the
    ELF .fuse section.
    
    The global variable is declared in the FUSES macro has two leading 
    underscores, which means that it is reserved for the "implementation",
    meaning the library, so it will not conflict with a user-named variable.
    
    You must initialize ALL fields in the __fuse_t structure. This is because
    the fuse bits in all bytes default to a logical 1, meaning unprogrammed. 
    Normal uninitialized data defaults to all locgial zeros. So it is vital that
    all fuse bytes are initialized, even with default data. If they are not,
    then the fuse bits may not programmed to the desired settings.
    
    Be sure to have the -mmcu=<em>device</em> flag in your compile command line and
    your linker command line to have the correct device selected and to have 
    the correct I/O header file included when you include <avr/io.h>.
    You can print out the contents of the .fuse section in the ELF file by
    using this command line:
    \code
    avr-objdump -s -j .fuse <ELF file>
    \endcode
    The section contents shows the address on the left, then the data going from
    lower address to a higher address, left to right.

/** \defgroup avr_lock <avr/lock.h>: Lockbit Support
    \par Introduction
    The Lockbit API allows a user to specify the lockbit settings for the 
    specific AVR device they are compiling for. These lockbit settings will be 
    placed in a special section in the ELF output file, after linking.
    Programming tools can take advantage of the lockbit information embedded in
    the ELF file, by extracting this information and determining if the lockbits
    need to be programmed after programming the Flash and EEPROM memories.
    This also allows a single ELF file to contain all the
    information needed to program an AVR. 
    To use the Lockbit API, include the <avr/io.h> header file, which in turn
    automatically includes the individual I/O header file and the <avr/lock.h>
    file. These other two files provides everything necessary to set the AVR
    lockbits.
    
    \par Lockbit API
    
    Each I/O header file may define up to 3 macros that controls what kinds
    of lockbits are available to the user.
    
    If __LOCK_BITS_EXIST is defined, then two lock bits are available to the
    user and 3 mode settings are defined for these two bits.
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_BITS_0_EXIST is defined, then the two BLB0 lock bits are
    available to the user and 4 mode settings are defined for these two bits.
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_BITS_1_EXIST is defined, then the two BLB1 lock bits are
    available to the user and 4 mode settings are defined for these two bits.
    If __BOOT_LOCK_APPLICATION_TABLE_BITS_EXIST is defined then two lock bits
    are available to set the locking mode for the Application Table Section 
    (which is used in the XMEGA family).
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_APPLICATION_BITS_EXIST is defined then two lock bits are
    available to set the locking mode for the Application Section (which is used
    in the XMEGA family).
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_BOOT_BITS_EXIST is defined then two lock bits are available
    to set the locking mode for the Boot Loader Section (which is used in the
    XMEGA family).
    The AVR lockbit modes have inverted values, logical 1 for an unprogrammed 
    (disabled) bit and logical 0 for a programmed (enabled) bit. The defined 
    macros for each individual lock bit represent this in their definition by a 
    bit-wise inversion of a mask. For example, the LB_MODE_3 macro is defined 
    as:
    \code
    #define LB_MODE_3  (0xFC)
`   \endcode
    
    To combine the lockbit mode macros together to represent a whole byte,
    use the bitwise AND operator, like so:
    \code
    (LB_MODE_3 & BLB0_MODE_2)
    \endcode
    
    <avr/lock.h> also defines a macro that provides a default lockbit value:
    LOCKBITS_DEFAULT which is defined to be 0xFF.
    See the AVR device specific datasheet for more details about these
    lock bits and the available mode settings.
    
    A convenience macro, LOCKMEM, is defined as a GCC attribute for a 
    custom-named section of ".lock".
    
    A convenience macro, LOCKBITS, is defined that declares a variable, __lock, 
    of type unsigned char with the attribute defined by LOCKMEM. This variable
    allows the end user to easily set the lockbit data.
    \note If a device-specific I/O header file has previously defined LOCKMEM,
    then LOCKMEM is not redefined. If a device-specific I/O header file has
    previously defined LOCKBITS, then LOCKBITS is not redefined. LOCKBITS is
    currently known to be defined in the I/O header files for the XMEGA devices.
    \par API Usage Example
    
    Putting all of this together is easy:
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>
    LOCKBITS = (LB_MODE_1 & BLB0_MODE_3 & BLB1_MODE_4);
    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    Or:
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>
    unsigned char __lock __attribute__((section (".lock"))) = 
        (LB_MODE_1 & BLB0_MODE_3 & BLB1_MODE_4);
    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    
    
    However there are a number of caveats that you need to be aware of to
    use this API properly.
    
    Be sure to include <avr/io.h> to get all of the definitions for the API.
    The LOCKBITS macro defines a global variable to store the lockbit data. This 
    variable is assigned to its own linker section. Assign the desired lockbit 
    values immediately in the variable initialization.
    
    The .lock section in the ELF file will get its values from the initial 
    variable assignment ONLY. This means that you can NOT assign values to 
    this variable in functions and the new values will not be put into the
    ELF .lock section.
    
    The global variable is declared in the LOCKBITS macro has two leading 
    underscores, which means that it is reserved for the "implementation",
    meaning the library, so it will not conflict with a user-named variable.
    
    You must initialize the lockbit variable to some meaningful value, even
    if it is the default value. This is because the lockbits default to a 
    logical 1, meaning unprogrammed. Normal uninitialized data defaults to all 
    locgial zeros. So it is vital that all lockbits are initialized, even with 
    default data. If they are not, then the lockbits may not programmed to the 
    desired settings and can possibly put your device into an unrecoverable 
    state.
    
    Be sure to have the -mmcu=<em>device</em> flag in your compile command line and
    your linker command line to have the correct device selected and to have 
    the correct I/O header file included when you include <avr/io.h>.
    You can print out the contents of the .lock section in the ELF file by
    using this command line:
    \code
    avr-objdump -s -j .lock <ELF file>

/** \defgroup avr_eeprom <avr/eeprom.h>: EEPROM handling
    \code #include <avr/eeprom.h> \endcode
    This header file declares the interface to some simple library
    routines suitable for handling the data EEPROM contained in the
    AVR microcontrollers.  The implementation uses a simple polled
    mode interface.  Applications that require interrupt-controlled
    EEPROM access to ensure that no time will be wasted in spinloops
    will have to deploy their own implementation.
    \par Notes:
    - In addition to the write functions there is a set of update ones.
    This functions read each byte first and skip the burning if the
    old value is the same with new.  The scaning direction is from
    high address to low, to obtain quick return in common cases.
    - All of the read/write functions first make sure the EEPROM is
    ready to be accessed.  Since this may cause long delays if a
    write operation is still pending, time-critical applications
    should first poll the EEPROM e. g. using eeprom_is_ready() before
    attempting any actual I/O.  But this functions are not wait until
    SELFPRGEN in SPMCSR becomes zero.  Do this manually, if your
    softwate contains the Flash burning.
    - As these functions modify IO registers, they are known to be
    non-reentrant.  If any of these functions are used from both,
    standard and interrupt context, the applications must ensure
    proper protection (e.g. by disabling interrupts before accessing
    them).
    - All write functions force erase_and_write programming mode.
    
    - For Xmega the EEPROM start address is 0, like other architectures.
    The reading functions add the 0x2000 value to use EEPROM mapping into
    data space.

/** \defgroup avr_power <avr/power.h>: Power Reduction Management
\code #include <avr/power.h>\endcode
Many AVRs contain a Power Reduction Register (PRR) or Registers (PRRx) that 
allow you to reduce power consumption by disabling or enabling various on-board 
peripherals as needed. Some devices have the XTAL Divide Control Register
(XDIV) which offer similar functionality as System Clock Prescale
Register (CLKPR).
There are many macros in this header file that provide an easy interface
to enable or disable on-board peripherals to reduce power. See the table below.
\note Not all AVR devices have a Power Reduction Register (for example
the ATmega8). On those devices without a Power Reduction Register, the
power reduction macros are not available..
\note Not all AVR devices contain the same peripherals (for example, the LCD
interface), or they will be named differently (for example, USART and 
USART0). Please consult your device's datasheet, or the header file, to 
find out which macros are applicable to your device.
\note For device using the XTAL Divide Control Register (XDIV), when prescaler
is used, Timer/Counter0 can only be used in asynchronous mode. Keep in mind
that Timer/Counter0 source shall be less than th of peripheral clock.
Therefore, when using a typical 32.768 kHz crystal, one shall not scale
the clock below 131.072 kHz.

/** \defgroup avr_sleep <avr/sleep.h>: Power Management and Sleep Modes
    \code #include <avr/sleep.h>\endcode
    Use of the \c SLEEP instruction can allow an application to reduce its
    power comsumption considerably. AVR devices can be put into different
    sleep modes. Refer to the datasheet for the details relating to the device
    you are using.
    There are several macros provided in this header file to actually
    put the device into sleep mode.  The simplest way is to optionally
    set the desired sleep mode using \c set_sleep_mode() (it usually
    defaults to idle mode where the CPU is put on sleep but all
    peripheral clocks are still running), and then call
    \c sleep_mode(). This macro automatically sets the sleep enable bit, goes 
    to sleep, and clears the sleep enable bit.
    
    Example:
    \code
    #include <avr/sleep.h>
    ...
      set_sleep_mode(<mode>);
      sleep_mode();
    \endcode
    
    Note that unless your purpose is to completely lock the CPU (until a 
    hardware reset), interrupts need to be enabled before going to sleep.
    As the \c sleep_mode() macro might cause race conditions in some
    situations, the individual steps of manipulating the sleep enable
    (SE) bit, and actually issuing the \c SLEEP instruction, are provided
    in the macros \c sleep_enable(), \c sleep_disable(), and
    \c sleep_cpu().  This also allows for test-and-sleep scenarios that
    take care of not missing the interrupt that will awake the device
    from sleep.
    Example:
    \code
    #include <avr/interrupt.h>
    #include <avr/sleep.h>
    ...
      set_sleep_mode(<mode>);
      cli();
      if (some_condition)
      {
        sleep_enable();
        sei();
        sleep_cpu();
        sleep_disable();
      }
      sei();
    \endcode
    This sequence ensures an atomic test of \c some_condition with
    interrupts being disabled.  If the condition is met, sleep mode
    will be prepared, and the \c SLEEP instruction will be scheduled
    immediately after an \c SEI instruction.  As the intruction right
    after the \c SEI is guaranteed to be executed before an interrupt
    could trigger, it is sure the device will really be put to sleep.
    Some devices have the ability to disable the Brown Out Detector (BOD) before 
    going to sleep. This will also reduce power while sleeping. If the
    specific AVR device has this ability then an additional macro is defined:
    \c sleep_bod_disable(). This macro generates inlined assembly code
    that will correctly implement the timed sequence for disabling the BOD
    before sleeping. However, there is a limited number of cycles after the
    BOD has been disabled that the device can be put into sleep mode, otherwise
    the BOD will not truly be disabled. Recommended practice is to disable
    the BOD (\c sleep_bod_disable()), set the interrupts (\c sei()), and then
    put the device to sleep (\c sleep_cpu()), like so:
    \code
    #include <avr/interrupt.h>
    #include <avr/sleep.h>
    ...
      set_sleep_mode(<mode>);
      cli();
      if (some_condition)
      {
        sleep_enable();
        sleep_bod_disable();
        sei();
        sleep_cpu();
        sleep_disable();
      }
      sei();
    \endcode

/** \defgroup avr_watchdog <avr/wdt.h>: Watchdog timer handling
    \code #include <avr/wdt.h> \endcode
    This header file declares the interface to some inline macros
    handling the watchdog timer present in many AVR devices.  In order
    to prevent the watchdog timer configuration from being
    accidentally altered by a crashing application, a special timed
    sequence is required in order to change it.  The macros within
    this header file handle the required sequence automatically
    before changing any value.  Interrupts will be disabled during
    the manipulation.
    \note Depending on the fuse configuration of the particular
    device, further restrictions might apply, in particular it might
    be disallowed to turn off the watchdog timer.
    Note that for newer devices (ATmega88 and newer, effectively any
    AVR that has the option to also generate interrupts), the watchdog
    timer remains active even after a system reset (except a power-on
    condition), using the fastest prescaler value (approximately 15
    ms).  It is therefore required to turn off the watchdog early
    during program startup, the datasheet recommends a sequence like
    the following:
    \code
    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <avr/wdt.h>
    uint8_t mcusr_mirror __attribute__ ((section (".noinit")));
    void get_mcusr(void)       __attribute__((naked))       __attribute__((section(".init3")));
));
    void get_mcusr(void)
    {
      mcusr_mirror = MCUSR;
      MCUSR = 0;
      wdt_disable();
    }
    \endcode
    Saving the value of MCUSR in \c mcusr_mirror is only needed if the
    application later wants to examine the reset source, but in particular, 
    clearing the watchdog reset flag before disabling the
    watchdog is required, according to the datasheet.

/**
   \ingroup avr_watchdog
   Symbolic constants for the watchdog timeout.  Since the watchdog
   timer is based on a free-running RC oscillator, the times are
   approximate only and apply to a supply voltage of 5 V.  At lower
   supply voltages, the times will increase.  For older devices, the
   times will be as large as three times when operating at Vcc = 3 V,
   while the newer devices (e. g. ATmega128, ATmega8) only experience
   a negligible change.
   Possible timeout values are: 15 ms, 30 ms, 60 ms, 120 ms, 250 ms,
   500 ms, 1 s, 2 s.  (Some devices also allow for 4 s and 8 s.)
   Symbolic constants are formed by the prefix
   \c WDTO_, followed by the time.
   Example that would select a watchdog timer expiry of approximately
   500 ms:
   \code
   wdt_enable(WDTO_500MS);

    The functions in this module provide interfaces for a program to access
    data stored in program space (flash memory) of the device.  In order to
    use these functions, the target device must support either the \c LPM or
    \c ELPM instructions.
    \note These functions are an attempt to provide some compatibility with
    header files that come with IAR C, to make porting applications between
    different compilers easier.  This is not 100% compatibility though (GCC
    does not have full support for multiple address spaces yet).
    \note If you are working with strings which are completely based in ram,
    use the standard string functions described in \ref avr_string.
    \note If possible, put your constant tables in the lower 64 KB and use
    pgm_read_byte_near() or pgm_read_word_near() instead of
    pgm_read_byte_far() or pgm_read_word_far() since it is more efficient that
    way, and you can still use the upper 64K for executable code.
    All functions that are suffixed with a \c _P \e require their
    arguments to be in the lower 64 KB of the flash ROM, as they do
    not use ELPM instructions.  This is normally not a big concern as
    the linker setup arranges any program space constants declared
    using the macros from this header file so they are placed right after
    the interrupt vectors, and in front of any executable code.  However,
    it can become a problem if there are too many of these constants, or
    for bootloaders on devices with more than 64 KB of ROM.
    <em>All these functions will not work in that situation.</em>
    \note For <b>Xmega</b> devices, make sure the NVM controller
    command register (\c NVM.CMD or \c NVM_CMD) is set to 0x00 (NOP)
    before using any of these functions.

/** \defgroup avr_io <avr/io.h>: AVR device-specific IO definitions
    \code #include <avr/io.h> \endcode
    This header file includes the apropriate IO definitions for the
    device that has been specified by the <tt>-mmcu=</tt> compiler
    command-line switch.  This is done by diverting to the appropriate
    file <tt>&lt;avr/io</tt><em>XXXX</em><tt>.h&gt;</tt> which should
    never be included directly.  Some register names common to all
    AVR devices are defined directly within <tt>&lt;avr/common.h&gt;</tt>,
    which is included in <tt>&lt;avr/io.h&gt;</tt>,
    but most of the details come from the respective include file.
    Note that this file always includes the following files:
    \code 
    #include <avr/sfr_defs.h>
    #include <avr/portpins.h>
    #include <avr/common.h>
    #include <avr/version.h>
    \endcode
    See \ref avr_sfr for more details about that header file.
    Included are definitions of the IO register set and their
    respective bit values as specified in the Atmel documentation.
    Note that inconsistencies in naming conventions,
    so even identical functions sometimes get different names on
    different devices.
    Also included are the specific names useable for interrupt
    function definitions as documented
    \ref avr_signames "here".
    Finally, the following macros are defined:
    - \b RAMEND
    <br>
    The last on-chip RAM address.
    <br>
    - \b XRAMEND
    <br>
    The last possible RAM location that is addressable. This is equal to 
    RAMEND for devices that do not allow for external RAM. For devices 
    that allow external RAM, this will be larger than RAMEND.
    <br>
    - \b E2END
    <br>
    The last EEPROM address.
    <br>
    - \b FLASHEND
    <br>
    The last byte address in the Flash program space.
    <br>
    - \b SPM_PAGESIZE
    <br>
    For devices with bootloader support, the flash pagesize
    (in bytes) to be used for the \c SPM instruction. 
    - \b E2PAGESIZE
    <br>
    The size of the EEPROM page.

/** \ingroup avr_pgmspace
    \def pgm_get_far_address(var)
   This macro facilitates the obtention of a 32 bit "far" pointer (only 24 bits
   used) to data even passed the 64KB limit for the 16 bit ordinary pointer. It
   is similar to the '&' operator, with some limitations.
   Comments:
   - The overhead is minimal and it's mainly due to the 32 bit size operation.
   - 24 bit sizes guarantees the code compatibility for use in future devices.
   - hh8() is an undocumented feature but seems to give the third significant byte
     of a 32 bit data and accepts symbols, complementing the functionality of hi8()
     and lo8(). There is not an equivalent assembler function to get the high
     significant byte.
   - 'var' has to be resolved at linking time as an existing symbol, i.e, a simple
     type variable name, an array name (not an indexed element of the array, if the
     index is a constant the compiler does not complain but fails to get the address
     if optimization is enabled), a struct name or a struct field name, a function
     identifier, a linker defined identifier,...
   - The returned value is the identifier's VMA (virtual memory address) determined
     by the linker and falls in the corresponding memory region. The AVR Harvard
     architecture requires non overlapping VMA areas for the multiple address spaces
     in the processor: Flash ROM, RAM, and EEPROM. Typical offset for this are
     0x00000000, 0x00800xx0, and 0x00810000 respectively, derived from the linker
     script used and linker options. The value returned can be seen then as a
     universal pointer.

/** \defgroup util_delay_basic <util/delay_basic.h>: Basic busy-wait delay loops
    \code
    #include <util/delay_basic.h>
    \endcode
    The functions in this header file implement simple delay loops
    that perform a busy-waiting.  They are typically used to
    facilitate short delays in the program execution.  They are
    implemented as count-down loops with a well-known CPU cycle
    count per loop iteration.  As such, no other processing can
    occur simultaneously.  It should be kept in mind that the
    functions described here do not disable interrupts.
    In general, for long delays, the use of hardware timers is
    much preferrable, as they free the CPU, and allow for
    concurrent processing of other events while the timer is
    running.  However, in particular for very short delays, the
    overhead of setting up a hardware timer is too much compared
    to the overall delay time.
    Two inline functions are provided for the actual delay algorithms.

    including the overhead the compiler needs to setup the counter
    register.
