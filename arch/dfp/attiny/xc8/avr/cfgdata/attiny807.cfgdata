#
# File Syntax:
# Each configuration register is given as:
#
#     CWORD:<address>:<mask>:<default value>[:<name>[,<alias list>]]
#
# for each CWORD the configuration settings are listed as
#
#     CSETTING:<mask>:<name>[,<alias list>]:<description>
#
# lastly for each CSETTING all possible values are listed as
#
#     CVALUE:<value>:<name>[,<alias list>]:<description>
#
# All numerical values are given in unqualified hex.  In terms of
# #pragma config, note the following correspondence:
#
#    #pragma config CSETTING<name> = CVALUE<name>
#
# Comments are also permitted.  Any line beginning with a '#'
# character will be treated as a comment.
