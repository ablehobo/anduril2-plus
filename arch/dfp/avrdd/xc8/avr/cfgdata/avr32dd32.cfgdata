#     CSETTING:<mask>:<name>[,<alias list>]:<description>
#
# lastly for each CSETTING all possible values are listed as
#
#     CVALUE:<value>:<name>[,<alias list>]:<description>
#
# All numerical values are given in unqualified hex.  In terms of
# #pragma config, note the following correspondence:
